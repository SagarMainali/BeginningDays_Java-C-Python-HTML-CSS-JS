# BeginningDays_Java-C-Python-Html-Css

This repo is not really about the PROJECTS but rather contains the codes that I wrote while figuring out programming languages. For now I have hands-on in Java, C,    Python, Html and Css---(many more to learn). 
Creted this repo dedicating to only the booring stuff you do while learning programming languages but important since those were the first steps.
