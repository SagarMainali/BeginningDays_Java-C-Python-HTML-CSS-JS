# BeginningDays_Java-C-Python-Html-Css

This repo is not really about the PROJECTS but rather contains the codes that I wrote while figuring out programming languages. This repo contains codes of Java, C,    Python, Html, Css and JS---(many more to learn). 
Created this repo dedicating to only the booring stuff you do while learning programming languages but important since those were the first steps.
